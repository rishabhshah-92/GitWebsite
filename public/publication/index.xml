      <title>Urban Oxidation Flow Reactor Measurements Reveal Significant Secondary Organic Aerosol Contributions from Volatile Emissions of Emerging Importance</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows a significant pool of emissions of volatile organic compounds from non-combustion sources in urban environments. Non-combustion sources include personal care products, paints, adhesives, and other petrochemical products. We used an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) to demonstrate that there is excess secondary particulate matter formation potential in densely populated areas because of this pool of vapors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;behind-the-scenes&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind the scenes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 of this paper shows about 30 min of data collected by two instrumented vans driving alongside each other around a construction site in Pittsburgh. The NOAA van measured the amounts of different reactive organic gases (e.g., those emitted from deodorants, paints, etc.) in the air, while the Carnegie Mellon van oxidized this air to measure the reactivity of these gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this 30 min of sampling in Pittsburgh was just a test of whether or not this sampling strategy would work. Having gotten encouraging results, we next planned to apply this promising sampling strategy in populous parts of Manhattan e.g., Times Square, where the population density would be very high, and thus we would be able to observe a strong signal of personal care products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus drove to New York City, and set up our base at the City College of New York main campus in Harlem. We started making detailed plans about how to perform our mobile sampling: we planned routes, we planned times of day to sample, we even planned a sampling route from Morristown, NJ to Stony Brook, NY (cutting right through Manhattan, of course), hoping to capture the rural-urban-rural gradient of various air pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, the most vital instrument on the Carnegie Mellon van malfunctioned (the same instrument that also malfunctioned a year earlier in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rishabhshah.netlify.app/publication/acp-oakland/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike Oakland, however, we could not revive the instrument in time for the planned measurements this time. I hope someone else gets an opportunity to do the measurements that I could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the data collected while we were stationary at our base station in Harlem proved immensely useful. These are the data are ended up being in this paper! And, while it was a much shorter road trip than the one from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rishabhshah.netlify.app/publication/acp-oakland/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh to Oakland&lt;/a&gt;, I did manage to take a few pictures on the road:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Land-Use Regression Modeling of Source-Resolved Fine Particulate Matter Components from Mobile Sampling</title>
      <link>/publication/est-oaklandlur/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keywords: land-use regression, statistical modeling, urban particulate matter, vehicular emissions, cooking emissions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents land-use regression (LUR) models for submicron particulate matter (PM) components from an urban area. This study represents the first time that LUR has been applied to source-resolved PM. Our stepwise selective LUR algorithm largely selected predictors for primary factors that correspond to the associated land-use categories (e.g., cooking land-use variables were selected in cooking-related PM models). This finding appears to be robust, as we demonstrate the predictive link between land-use variables and the corresponding source-resolved PM components through a subsampling analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-spatial-resolution mapping and source apportionment of aerosol composition in Oakland, California, using mobile aerosol mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>/publication/acp-oakland/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/publication/acp-oakland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keywords: spatial patterns of particulate matter, mobile sampling, mass spectrometry, vehicular emissions, cooking emissions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured spatial differences in airborne particulate matter (PM) in Oakland, CA, with repeated mobile measurements on all city streets. In addition to primary, we also find higher secondary organic PM downtown, which suggests stronger photochemical PM production in areas of high emissions and poor air ventilation (i.e., urban street canyons). This finding is original because while other modeling studies have predicted higher photochemistry in street canyons, we confirm this observationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;behind-the-scenes&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we drove our instrumented van from Pittsburgh, PA to Berkeley, CA. And yes, it was beautiful, especially once we were west of Kansas (some pictures below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the paper says that the measurement campaign began on 10th July 2017, it was originally supposed to begin on 24th June 2017. However, upon arrival in Berkeley, we discovered that our instrument was not working. We ended up spending 2 weeks trying to fix the instrument. This involved taking apart the instrument again and again, ruling out one potential source of malfunction after the next. Every day was the same drill: open a part of the instrument, visually inspect the complex circuitry, take lots of pictures, put it back together. And all this while also exchanging emails and phone calls with the instrument manufacturer, desperate shouts for help in the Berkeley area, even a trip up to Davis, CA, in the hopes of getting diagnostic help from researchers at UC Davis. Finally, it turned out to be a bad electric connection in a high-voltage unit of the instrument. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of me preparing a soldering station to fix this connection at our AirBnB.

&lt;p&gt;And now, here are some pictures of the road trip:&lt;/p&gt;
