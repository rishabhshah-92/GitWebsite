[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Office of Chief Scientist at Environmental Defense Fund. My research interests include studying air pollutants like particulate matter, atmospheric science, and environmental justice in exposure to air pollution.\nI first stepped into the field of air pollution in 2012, when I was majoring in Environmental Engineering at my undergraduate program. I was disappointed that a vast majority of the available courses in the department were related to water quality. I thus started reading up on air pollutants, their sources, their mitigation strategies, etc. as a side project.\nMy hobbies include cycling, swimming, and watching DIY videos on YouTube on a variety of topics e.g., fixing basic issues with computers, maintaining bikes, interesting tutorials on data analysis and visualization techniques, etc.\nI very strongly support open-source software, and I believe students should be discouraged from becoming dependent on expensive proprietary software (e.g., MS Office) for their academic/professional use, if an open-source alternative exists. I would go into details, but I think this page presents the rationale behind supporting open-source software perfectly. Based on personal experience, here are some recommendations I have for open-source software that are just as good (or in some cases, much better) compared to their proprietary counterparts:\n   Purpose Licensed/Proprietary software Free/Open-source alternative     Scientific writing Microsoft Word (very inefficient for this purpose)  LaTeX   Non-scientific writing Microsoft Word  Libre Writer   Presentations Microsoft PowerPoint  Libre Impress   Spreadsheets Microsoft Excel  Libre Calc   Programming and data analysis MATLAB, Igor Pro  RStudio   Relational database management Microsoft Access  DB Browser   Geospatial analysis ArcGIS  Q-GIS   GUI-based scientific plotting MATLAB, Grapher, Origin, Igor Pro, etc.  Veusz    ","date":1576713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1576713600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/rishabh-u.-shah/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/rishabh-u.-shah/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Office of Chief Scientist at Environmental Defense Fund.

This study represents the first time that LUR has been applied to source-resolved PM. Our stepwise selective LUR algorithm largely selected predictors for primary factors that correspond to the associated land-use categories (e.g., cooking land-use variables were selected in cooking-related PM models). This finding appears to be robust, as we demonstrate the predictive link between land-use variables and the corresponding source-resolved PM components through a subsampling analysis.","tags":null,"title":"Land-Use Regression Modeling of Source-Resolved Fine Particulate Matter Components from Mobile Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rishabh U.

In addition to primary, we also find higher secondary organic PM downtown, which suggests stronger photochemical PM production in areas of high emissions and poor air ventilation (i.e., urban street canyons). This finding is original because while other modeling studies have predicted higher photochemistry in street canyons, we confirm this observationally.","tags":null,"title":"High-spatial-resolution mapping and source apportionment of aerosol composition in Oakland, California, using mobile aerosol mass spectrometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
