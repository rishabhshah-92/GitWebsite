My research interests include studying air pollutants like particulate matter, atmospheric science, and environmental justice in exposure to air pollution.\nI first stepped into the field of air pollution in 2012, when I was majoring in Environmental Engineering at my undergraduate program. I was disappointed that a vast majority of the available courses in the department were related to water quality. I thus started reading up on air pollutants, their sources, their mitigation strategies, etc. as a side project.\nMy hobbies include cycling, swimming, and watching DIY videos on YouTube on a variety of topics e.g., fixing basic issues with computers, maintaining bikes, interesting tutorials on data analysis and visualization techniques, etc.\nI very strongly support open-source software, and I believe students should be discouraged from becoming dependent on expensive proprietary software (e.g., MATLAB) for their academic/professional use, if an open-source alternative exists. I would go into details, but I think this page presents the rationale behind supporting open-source software perfectly. Based on personal experience, here are some recommendations I have for open-source software that are just as good (or in some cases, much better) compared to their proprietary counterparts:\n   Purpose Licensed/Proprietary software Free/Open-source alternative     Scientific writing Microsoft Word (very inefficient for this purpose)  LaTeX   Non-scientific writing Microsoft Word  Libre Writer   Presentations Microsoft PowerPoint  Libre Impress   Spreadsheets Microsoft Excel  Libre Calc   Programming and data analysis MATLAB, Igor Pro  RStudio   Relational database management Microsoft Access  DB Browser   Geospatial analysis ArcGIS  Q-GIS   GUI-based scientific plotting Grapher, Origin, Igor Pro, etc.  Veusz    ","date":1601337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1601337600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/rishabh-u.-shah/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/rishabh-u.-shah/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Office of Chief Scientist at Environmental Defense Fund.","tags":null,"title":"Rishabh U.

Non-combustion sources include personal care products, paints, adhesives, and other petrochemical products. We used an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) to demonstrate that there is excess secondary particulate matter formation potential in densely populated areas because of this pool of vapors.\nBehind the scenes: Figure 4 of this paper shows about 30 min of data collected by two instrumented vans driving alongside each other around a construction site in Pittsburgh. The NOAA van measured the amounts of different reactive organic gases (e.g., those emitted from deodorants, paints, etc.) in the air, while the Carnegie Mellon van oxidized this air to measure the reactivity of these gases.\nIncidentally, this 30 min of sampling in Pittsburgh was just a test of whether or not this sampling strategy would work. Having gotten encouraging results, we next planned to apply this promising sampling strategy in populous parts of Manhattan e.g., Times Square, where the population density would be very high, and thus we would be able to observe a strong signal of personal care products.\nWe thus drove to New York City, and set up our base at the City College of New York main campus in Harlem. We started making detailed plans about how to perform our mobile sampling: we planned routes, we planned times of day to sample, we even planned a sampling route from Morristown, NJ to Stony Brook, NY (cutting right through Manhattan, of course), hoping to capture the rural-urban-rural gradient of various air pollutants.\nAnd then, of course, the most vital instrument on the Carnegie Mellon van malfunctioned (the same instrument that also malfunctioned a year earlier in Oakland). Unlike Oakland, however, we could not revive the instrument in time for the planned measurements this time. I hope someone else gets an opportunity to do the measurements that I could not.\nFortunately, the data collected while we were stationary at our base station in Harlem proved immensely useful. These are the data are ended up being in this paper! And, while it was a much shorter road trip than the one from Pittsburgh to Oakland, I did manage to take a few pictures on the road:\n  ","date":1576713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576713600,"objectID":"06402e4b4eccba68a08009d806eff58d","permalink":"/publication/est-ofr-vcp/","publishdate":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/est-ofr-vcp/","section":"publication","summary":"Keywords: urban secondary PM, volatile emissions, fragrances, vehicular emissions","tags":null,"title":"Urban Oxidation Flow Reactor Measurements Reveal Significant Secondary Organic Aerosol Contributions from Volatile Emissions of Emerging Importance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rishabh U.

In addition to primary, we also find higher secondary organic PM downtown, which suggests stronger photochemical PM production in areas of high emissions and poor air ventilation (i.e., urban street canyons). This finding is original because while other modeling studies have predicted higher photochemistry in street canyons, we confirm this observationally.\nBehind the scenes Yes, we drove our instrumented van from Pittsburgh, PA to Berkeley, CA. And yes, it was beautiful, especially once we were west of Kansas (some pictures below).\nThough the paper says that the measurement campaign began on 10th July 2017, it was originally supposed to begin on 24th June 2017. However, upon arrival in Berkeley, we discovered that our instrument was not working. We ended up spending 2 weeks trying to fix the instrument. This involved taking apart the instrument again and again, ruling out one potential source of malfunction after the next. Every day was the same drill: open a part of the instrument, visually inspect the complex circuitry, take lots of pictures, put it back together. And all this while also exchanging emails and phone calls with the instrument manufacturer, desperate shouts for help in the Berkeley area, even a trip up to Davis, CA, in the hopes of getting diagnostic help from researchers at UC Davis. Finally, it turned out to be a bad electric connection in a high-voltage unit of the instrument. Here\u0026rsquo;s a picture of me preparing a soldering station to fix this connection at our AirBnB.
