## **Summary**
This study presents land-use regression (LUR) models for submicron particulate matter (PM) components from an urban area. This study represents the first time that LUR has been applied to source-resolved PM. Our stepwise selective LUR algorithm largely selected predictors for primary factors that correspond to the associated land-use categories (e.g., cooking land-use variables were selected in cooking-related PM models). This finding appears to be robust, as we demonstrate the predictive link between land-use variables and the corresponding source-resolved PM components through a subsampling analysis.
