## **Summary** 
We observe increments in cooking PM levels within a 250 m buffer of restaurants, with variations occurring due to variables such as restaurant density and peak cooking times. These increments are representative of long-term averages, as well as acute episodes. Restaurant PM emissions are unevenly distributed among different socio-economic groups. In areas near restaurant emissions, the population comprises of more non-White population groups (African American, Hispanic, Asian, etc.), and a lower economic status, compared to areas far from restaurant emissions. Any socio-economic disparities in long-term and acute exposures to highway emissions are, at most, mild, and certainly small compared to disparities in exposure to restaurant emissions.
