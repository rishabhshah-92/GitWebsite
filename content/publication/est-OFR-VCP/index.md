summary: This study shows a significant pool of emissions of volatile organic compounds from non-combustion sources in urban environments. Non-combustion sources include personal care products, paints, adhesives, and other petrochemical products. We used an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) to demonstrate that there is excess secondary particulate matter formation potential in densely populated areas because of this pool of vapors.
